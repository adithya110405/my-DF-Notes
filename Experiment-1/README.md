Inference

The metadata indicates that this image originated as a JPEG file and was edited multiple times using Adobe Premiere Pro and GIMP.
No GPS coordinates are present, so location data cannot be determined.
The editing history shows that the file has been modified since its original creation, possibly involving both still image and video sources, 
as suggested by the "Ingredients" metadata.
